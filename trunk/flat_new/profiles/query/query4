Computer security is an application of Information Security to both theoretical and actual computer systems. For simplicity, issues of privacy vs valid reason to collect information should be handled under the subject of 'Information Privacy Rights'. For the purpose of this article, Computer security is a form of computer science risk management trade-offs in the areas of Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (see CIA Triad) of electronically structured information that is processed by or stored on computer systems.

The traditional approach is to create computing platforms, languages, and applications that enforce restrictions such that agents (i.e., users or programs) can only perform actions that have been allowed according to some specified security policy. Computer security can be seen as a subfield of security engineering, which looks at broader security issues in addition to computer security.
